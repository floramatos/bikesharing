# Getting Insights from NYC Citibike Data
Visualizing bike-sharing data with Tableau.

## Overview
The goal of the present analysis was to get insights from the New York City bike-sharing experience to plan the set up of similar services in a different U.S. city. To achieve this goal, NYC bike-sharing data from August 2019 was analyzed.

## Results
The analysis was conducted through Tableau. Here is the link to the full story: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/LineGraphs_Heatmaps/BikeSharingOverview?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

The first visualization shows the total number of rides in the month of August 2019, 2,344,224 rides, as well as the distribution of these rides per weekday and hour of the day the rides started. The heatmap enables to infer a pattern of trips per day of the week and hour of the day. That is, most weekday trips are taken during typical commute times and weekend trips are fairly spread out throughout the day.

After breaking the data down by gender, the second visualization confirms the weekday and weekend trips patter for all riders, independent of sex orientation. Also, the majority of riders self-identify as males.

The third visualization breaks down the data further by user type. Subscribers, rather than costumers, account for the majority of users. This visualization shows that subscribers self-identfying as males make the majority of trips and is the main public for the bike-sharing service.

In the fourth visualization, the main insight concerns trips duration. Most bike-sharing trips tend to be short, most last less than 1 hour.

Looking at it further, the short trip pattern doesn't change according to sex orientation.

The visualization of the top starting and ending trip locations confirms the short trip pattern further, as the maps look very similar.

Finally, a visualization of the number of times a bike was used was provided to provide patterns with respect to bike maintenance. More used bikes will probably need to be repaired sooner than less used bikes.


## Summary:
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.






Deliverable 2 questions

1) How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders?




2) How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders?




3) A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.





This zip file contains all the August 2019 data. We'll use data from August because there is likely more traffic during the summer months
